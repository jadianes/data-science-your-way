The simplest way to use cross-validation is to call the `cross_val_score` helper function on the estimator and the dataset. Once we have the values for each split, we can average them. We will repeat this operation for each value of the regularisation strength we want to explore. We could do that using `sklearn`'s `GridSearchCV`, but being a simple procedure, we will write the loop ourselves here for illustration purposes."
